			In this exercise, you will be asked to carry out a number of 
			tasks on a website.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the right side of the page, you will see a blue box with a 
			scenario and the current task you need to complete. Like the one 
			pictured below (and the one you probably just moved).
		</p>
		<p>
			To complete each task, you need to navigate through the website 
			until you feel you have completed the task and then select 
			<strong>'Task Complete'</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are having difficulty finishing the task, you can 
			select <strong>'Abandon Task'</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the box is in the way, use the controls on the left to move it 
			around or hide it. If your mouse gets stuck, just reload the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each set of tasks are followed by a few questions.
		</p>
		<h2>Some Background Information</h2>
		<p>
			The idea with this product is to create a platform that enables 
			teachers like you to use popular technology to engage with students 
			between the ages of 13-17 in the class room.
		</p>
		<p>
			This piece of the product allows you to setup a live video stream and live conversation. In the class this tool would allow you to connect experts, other teachers 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Our aim is to help you craft an interesting, relevant and engaging 
			experience based on a curriculum. We want to help students 
			understand their impact, the problems they are helping solve, and 
			reflect on everything you learned together. We would also like to 
			faciliate access to professionals and industry leaders for 
			career advice and inspiration.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Missions refer to the boat trips some of the student go on to get 
			hands on experience with ocean science.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The goal of this test is to understand if we have created a useful 
			product for you. Honest and constructive feedback is important and 
			enables us to design a better product  for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please only carry out the test once.</strong>
		</p>
		<h2>Are you ready?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Please remember &mdash; we are not evaluating you, we are 
			evaluating the website.</strong> All inputs are anonymous. You will 
			be testing a a prototype, which means that it is not fully 
			functional. But hopefully it will give you an idea of how this 
			would be a good or a bad thing in teaching ocean science.
